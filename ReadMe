# Kangalert – Wildlife Strike Reporting & Rescue 🦘

**Kangalert** is a mobile-friendly web app designed to help road users report wildlife strikes and notify local rescue services. It also provides a secure dashboard for authorised rescuers to manage reports, send updates, and coordinate volunteer responses.
